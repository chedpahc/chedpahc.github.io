Based in Korea, chedpahc is an artist who keenly explores the evolving modalities that shape the relationship between individuals and machines in a technologically accelerated environment. In his role as an operator, he has internalized a simultaneous expansion of possibility and impossibility, the depoliticization of speed, and the expansion and transformation of the body as it interacts with media interfacesâ€”coupled with an unsettling attitude of a player. Drawing on these experiences, he weaves his work by interlacing computer codes. The resulting fabric can be a combination of independent generative systems, real-time or pre-rendered moving images and MIDI sound, as well as custom hardware devices. These typically emerge as performances, installations, and recordings.
